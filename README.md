# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Starter Code

Slim Jenkins has the existing code on Github, so you need to download it from there. Actually, developers call this process _cloning a repository_.

In your terminal, to go your workspace directory.

```sh
cd ~/workspace
```

Then clone the repository to your machine with the following command.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Nashville-Software-School-Assessments/bug-wrangler-ranch.git
```

This will create a new sub-directory called `bug-wrangler-ranch`. Use the `cd` command to navigate into that directory and open it in VS Code.

```sh
cd bug-wrangler-ranch
code .
```

Open the `main.js` and create your `launch.json` so that you can debug the code starting with `main.js`. Then run the program and start the investigation.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below.

```sh
************************************************

                               ||   (__)
                               ||w--||     \|/

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,
Ankole-Watusi,American Angus,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankole-Watusi,
Ankole-Watusi,American Angus,Ankina,Ankina,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,
American Angus,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,American Angus,

American Angus,Ankole-Watusi,Ankina,American Angus,Brown Swiss

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

## Vocabulary and Understanding

> ðŸ§¨ Before you click the "Assessment Complete" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below for each question and make a commit. It is your option to request a face-to-face meeting with a coach for a vocabulary review.

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > `drovers` will store the appropriate amount of drovers we need to hire to drive the cattle. The drovers variable is deteremined by accessing the data for all possible drovers. Then we decide how many drovers will be needed by referencing how many `cattleToDrive` was input. Once that number is determined we push the appropriate amount of random drovers into the drovers array.
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > `drover` is the amount of drovers that have been pushed into the array and the for loop will iterate this many times. `drovers` is just telling the for loop which variable to loop over. In this case it is an array of drovers first and last names that was created earlier from the data set.  
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > (https://www.loom.com/share/7d13e0d27040456f8d3e04ba2827a50c)
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
      journey.push("forest")
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.
   > This is a for loop that allows you to set a variable `forestNumber` that give you more control for how many times the for loop will operate. Setting `forestNumber` = 0 tells the loop to start at 0. The next statement tells the loop how many times to iterate. Because "areas.forests" calls a function that generates a random number, this will change every time the for loop is run. The final statement of the for loop tells the loop how much to increment by. In this case, we are incrementing by + 1. Depending on the random number generated, we will push the string "forest" into the journey array exactly that many times.
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > The database variable is an object that stores two arrays "cattleTypes" and "drovers" within both of those arrays are multiple objects that store information about the cattleTyples and drovers.
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > herdSize is a parameter for the hireDrovers function. It gets it value from the argument provided in main.js. The function is invoked with the argument "cattleToDrive" and stored in variable "drovers".


## Final Step

Now you need to upload your code to Github so a coach can review it and the answers to your vocabulary and understanding questions.
